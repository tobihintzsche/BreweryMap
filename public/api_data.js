Although no longer the largest brewery in the world, it is still the largest brewer of stout in the world. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the brewery owned most of the buildings in the surrounding area, including many streets of housing for brewery employees, and offices associated with the brewery. The brewery also made all of its own power using its own power plant.\r\n\r\nThere is an attached exhibition on the 250-year-old history of Guinness, called the Guinness Storehouse.","website":"http:\/\/www.guinness.com\/","established":"1759","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HaPdSL\/upload_b3rzyZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HaPdSL\/upload_b3rzyZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HaPdSL\/upload_b3rzyZ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HaPdSL\/upload_b3rzyZ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HaPdSL\/upload_b3rzyZ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:01","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N"},"country":{"isoCode":"IE","name":"IRELAND","displayName":"Ireland","isoThree":"IRL","numberCode":372,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"HFQ27P","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"701 S. 50th Street","locality":"West Philly","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"19143","phone":"(215)-726-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.dockstreetbeer.com","latitude":39.9477956,"longitude":-75.2229305,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:14:56","breweryId":"p3YrOa","brewery":{"id":"p3YrOa","name":"Dock Street Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Dock Street","description":"Founded in 1985, Dock Street Brewing Co. was the first microbrewery in Philadelphia and one of the first in the country.

Peter Egelston, Head Brewer in Northampton from 1987 until 1991, moved to Portsmouth to set up the new brewery here. (Egelston is now the sole proprietor of the Brewery.) \r\n\r\nThe brewing system consists of a custom made seven-barrel (210 gallons) JV Northwest brewhouse, two fourteen-barrel and three seven-barrel JV Northwest unitank (cylindroconical) fermenters, two fourteen-barrel horizontal fermenters (added later, in 1994), and twelve seven-barrel grundy cellar tanks. Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list.  All of the beers served at the Portsmouth Brewery are brewed right here on premise, with the exception of those beers, such as Shoals Pale Ale and Portsmouth Lager, brewed at Smuttynose Brewing Company, our sister company.","website":"http:\/\/www.portsmouthbrewery.com\/","established":"1991","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:01","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"aMIEke","name":"Merrimack","streetAddress":"221 Daniel Webster Hwy","locality":"Merrimack","region":"New Hampshire","postalCode":"03054","phone":"(603) 595-1202","website":"http:\/\/anheuser-busch.com\/","latitude":42.8252547,"longitude":-71.4861091,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1970","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-07-13 23:08:31","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:14:56","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","breweryId":"BznahA","brewery":{"id":"BznahA","name":"Anheuser-Busch InBev","nameShortDisplay":"Anheuser-Busch InBev","description":"Anheuser-Busch operates 12 breweries in the United States, 14 in China and one in the United Kingdom.
